# Vennegruppe_python
A python script to create new friend groups (vennegruppe). 

The concept Vennegruppe is part of the anti-bullying program in Norway. The children are divided in groups of 4-5 children twice a year. Within six months the group is invited into the homes of the other group members to get to know each other and their parents. This way they get to know all their classmates better, as well as their parents and homes. When children know each other better there is often less bullying happening in and outside the classroom.

This script is being developed to help create the (new) groups. Vennegruppe is part of elementary school in Norway, so twice a year for seven years these groups are made. But creating these groups manually so that every child will meet all the other classmates in the course of seven years is really hard. Writing this basic script should make it easier to create these groups, with less instances of meeting the same child in the group over and over again.

This app uses the python/excel package openpyxl.

Currently the app is for commandline use only, a GUI for non-technical users will be made.

Usage of the app: python vennegruppe.py infile
